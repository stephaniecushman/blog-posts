## Always Learning

I've been having a difficult time this week focusing on learning, whether it was JavaScript or drawing boxes in my sketchbook or cooking new healthy recipes. I kept jumping back and forth between web development and drawing, only doing short bursts here and there. 

Then, after feeling scattered for a bit, I just decided I'd watch two high-level overviews of web development, one video was front-end and the other back-end, and I ended up sitting there mesmerized for an hour and a half. 

I didn't even notice the time going by because I was fascinated learning about all the different topics, whether it was CSS or JavaScript or APIs or servers and load balancers. After I was done, I felt like I could then go read my book about how to eat healthier. 

I was able to easily switch my focus, I think because I felt truly awesome after learning about those different topics in web development. I felt settled that I had learned so much there that I could then focus my attention onto the healthy eating book. 

Also later on that evening, I drew a lot of boxes, stairs, and ribbons in my sketchbook, all the objects I've been learning to draw and have wanted to draw lately. I think I was able to switch my focus yet again because of how I felt settled after I dedicated almost two hours to learning web development and felt like I learned it really well, and similarly how I was able to focus for a decent amount of time on my drawing.

Speaking of sitting there mesmerized for hours, what I said above about the overviews of web development reminds me of how a few months ago I learned about animate.css and my first thought was, 'Wow this is amazing! I must use this!' That is always my reaction to learning new technology in web development. 

I've always read that web developers have to love learning new technology because that's what you do in this career. It's the way it is since tech changes so quickly. 

I've been wondering for awhile now if I really do love to learn new tech. It hit me when I was learning all about animate.css that yes this shows I do love learning all things new tech. That was an important and welcome discovery since it is vital to succeeding in this career. What an amazing feeling when you realize something about yourself that you hadn't quite realized yet.
