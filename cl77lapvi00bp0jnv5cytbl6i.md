## My Tribute Page Project from Free Code Camp

[Tribute to Dorothy Vaughan](https://stephaniecushman.github.io/free-code-camp-project-tribute-page/)
I spent awhile on this project and ran into difficulties. I felt incredibly happy after I figured it all out. One thing I could do to improve this tribute page would be to resize the image. This size where you have to scroll down to see it all reminds me of the internet back in the late 1990s. ðŸ˜Š
