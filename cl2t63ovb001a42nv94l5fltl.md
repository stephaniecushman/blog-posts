## How to Problem Solve your Code

What do you do when you discover your code isn't working the way you are sure it should? Well the very first thing you should do is talk to a duck, a rubber duck to be specific.

Don't bug (hee hee) your coworkers just yet, you first need to talk to the rubber duck. When you have a bug in your code, you get an actual rubber duck and talk to it about what your code is doing. Go through every line of your code, telling the duck all about it (trust me, the duck is very interested). 

Chances are, you will come across your error and guess what? The cute rubber duck will still be smiling at you, a sure sign of encouragement. You'll be happy at having caught your error, the duck will be happy you caught your error, there's joy all around.

I suppose if you can't find a rubber duck or don't want to actually go buy one, you can just find a picture of one online. Printing it out will likely be best. Or you could even find a different object that's nearby. But there's probably nothing as happy and encouraging as a rubber duck.

If you really don't want to run your code by a duck, then you can think through your code in your head, but I don't think you'll have quite as much fun.

If the rubber duck has failed you (hey he's a duck, go easy on him), the next thing you can do if you're still stuck is go to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions). There you will find answers to frequently asked questions and you can view the answers that have the highest number of votes from the community. There is a green check mark next to answers to tell you that the person who asked the question found those answers helpful, which is very handy.

I hope this has been helpful to you. I found it useful to know these methods after I learned about them in my web development class.
